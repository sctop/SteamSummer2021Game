        <p>This app is an reimplentation of the game released during the Steam Summer Sale 2021. It's an experimental project that I used for practicing my programming skills.</p>
        <p>It is dedicated to be simple like this. It does not look beautiful obviously, and it may be a little boring and color-lacked -- but on eof the purpose of this recreation, that is, to enjoy the experience in which you read the story and make your own decision.</p>
        <p>I personally like the stories, and it's possible to even expand it. Each one has its own unique features, and they're interesting, in some ways.</p>
        <p>Anyways, you can read the full behind-the-scene story on my personal blog (the article will be available soon): </p>
